<h3 id="tokenbuilder">Token Builder</h3>

<p>Sometimes our great premade tokens might not be exactly what you are looking for. Maybe you just want more NPCs who aren’t wielding swords or giant cleavers. Maybe your elf draws his power from his majestic hair, but it MUST be purple or else you lose that +2 modifier on your roll. Whatever your reason, you have the power. You can build your own tokens by selecting from faces, hair, ears, armor, main-hand, off-hands, hats and bases all with a wide pallet of colors. With plans for regular updates to the available styles and equipment prepare to see a wider array of faces in playsets than ever before</p>
