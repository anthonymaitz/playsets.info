<h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2>

<p>Admittedly not the most exciting topic, but we want you to know what we’re tracking and learning, and share what we can.</p>

<p>We now know how many folks log on, what devices they’re using, which menus they look at in game, and how long they’re playing. This will help us debug issues with playsets and its UI/UX. It will also help us understand user loads to tweak performance.</p>

<p>We are also tracking which maps, features and tokens are the most popular. This isn’t super sophisticated at the moment, just the number of times used, but it is very important for the design and art department.</p>

<p>We want to make the popularity metrics public in the future.</p>
