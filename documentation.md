## The Jump Inn
The main menu is also a map, the Jump Inn!  From here you can create a campaign or join a session in progress with a story code shared with you.  You can play around and destroy the map, attack the villagers, and get some practice with playsets. The Jump Inn will reset the next time you load it.

> Tokens you create and save in the Jump Inn (using the [Token Builder](#tokenbuilder)) are available in the token select menu.

## Tokens
### Token Basics
#### Adding and Removing tokens
Click and hold anywhere on a map to place a token.  You can try this right on the main menu,  which is great place to look through tokens or build your own without the need to create a campaign and map.

#### Movement
Tokens leave a ghost behind when moving, allowing you to count squares more easily.

Double tapping a token now gives it a wobble so people who aren’t in the same room know exactly which spider is about to leap on their face.

If multiple tokens are in the same square you can toggle between them using the LAYER BUTTON.

> Characters can jump inside of wells using the layer button.

#### Emotes
#### Status Effects
#### Actions
Actions are ongoing effects and animations that you can apply to your tokens.  They are accessible in the token menu. Dance, sleep, etc to your token’s heart’s content.

#### Notes
Notes can be seen by all players as a text box above the token. It can also not be seen by all players, if you hide it.

Notes will fade behind status effects and will occasionally come to the front for readability.

#### Props
Some tokens are special. Those tokens are props. They have a lightbulb which lets you change the state of the prop.

You can light campfires and torches by placing fire on top of them.

#### Traps
Traps unhide and activate when tokens are placed on top of them.

### Advanced Features
#### Swapping
You can now swap tokens from the advanced token menu (hold down on the token for 2 seconds) Useful for shape shifters or hex spells.

#### Editing (Props)
#### Hiding Tokens
Tokens can be hidden from other players.  This is useful for hiding chests and other surprises good and bad.

Tokens placed by the story-teller (including hidden tokens) do not cause transparency (for players).  This will allow you to hide chests and place tokens in houses and caves without spoiling the surprise.  (or having to unhide every token)

#### Favoriting Tokens
Marking a token as a favorite, by toggling the start beneath the token in the token select menu, moves a copy of the token to the front of the token selection menu. Your saved custom tokens are placed with your favorites automatically.

### Token Builder
Sometimes our great premade tokens might not be exactly what you are looking for. Maybe you just want more NPCs who aren’t wielding swords or giant cleavers. Maybe your elf draws his power from his majestic hair, but it MUST be purple or else you lose that +2 modifier on your roll.  Whatever your reason, you have the power.  You can build your own tokens by selecting from faces, hair, ears, armor, main-hand, off-hands, hats and bases all with a wide pallet of colors.  With plans for regular updates to the available styles and equipment prepare to see a wider array of faces in playsets than ever before

### Custom Art Tokens

### Token Grouping
The grouping tool is a great way to hide and move multiple tokens at once.

## Builder tools
Creating a world map is one of the most rewarding parts of building your own campaign.  Playsets will help you make a beautiful map, and you can mark important spots with scaled down representations of all of our pre built maps.

We have a suite of BUILDER TOOLS as well as hundreds of props to help you make something amazing in a matter minutes, or hours, or weeks if you love to tinker.

### Analytics
Admittedly not the most exciting topic, but we want you to know what we’re tracking and learning, and share what we can.

We now know how many folks log on, what devices they’re using, which menus they look at in game, and how long they’re playing. This will help us debug issues with playsets and its UI/UX. It will also help us understand user loads to tweak performance.

We are also tracking which maps, features and tokens are the most popular. This isn’t super sophisticated at the moment, just the number of times used, but it is very important for the design and art department.

We want to make the popularity metrics public in the future.
